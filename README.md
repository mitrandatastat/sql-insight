# Business Data Insights Using SQL & SQLite	

This repository contains a data manipulation project that involves writing very complex SQL & SQLite queries to extract data, combine the data with tables, create views and integrate them to establish insights. These insights should help businesses to reframe strategies and align them with the current market trends. 

The complete technical writeup for this projet is available at my portfolio: https://portfolio.mshah.info/sql-insights/(https://portfolio.mshah.info/sql-insights/)

### Objectives

Below is the list of business questions that we are looking to answer as the outcome of this project while demonstrating working skills with SQL:

* How many music tracks are sold for different genres?

* What is the proportion of each genre sold to the overall sales volume?

* What is the purchase recommendation for the three most saleable artists based on the top 3 highest sold genres? 

* What are the three most saleable artists based on the individual song sale volumes?

* What is the sales performance of the sales staff?

* What is the relationship between seniority and the sales performance?

* What is the sales volume in the countries with underdeveloped sales markets?

* What are the marketing needs in countries with underdeveloped sales markets?

* What are the marketing needs in countries with developed sales market?

* What is the global market status in both market segments?

* Which are the countries under each market segment that require intensive marketing campaign?

* Should management buy only the most popular tracks or full albums from the record companies?

* Which artist is included in the most playlists?

* What is the overall global songs purchase history?

* Which are the top 2% most saleable songs in the store?

* Does the non-protected type of media have any effect on sales popularity?



### Goal Significance

Why does the list of objectives mentioned above matter? What benefit can we derive by getting the answers to the abovementioned business questions? Below are some of the goals that we can enlist. Exercising this technique will help us: 

* To identify the in-store inventory:
	1.	the most saleable songs and their artists amongst the all genres

	These findings will help policymakers to shape their global marketing and sales strategies

* To understand the performance of sales staff with their seniority and training to identify any possible flaws in the current system and introduce any changes necessary to improve it

* To recognize market clusters based on different variables such as:

	1.	Average sales value per customer
	2.	Average order value
	3.	Total order volume

	These findings should help the organization evaluate their market status in different market segments.

* To realize the consumer purchase pattern concerning:

	1.	Full Album vs. Popular Tracks

	2.	Protected vs. Non-Protected Media

	These findings should help management: 
	
	o	make appropriate decisions about inventory selection 	
	
	o	frame market promotion policies

	o	develop negotiating guidelines with record companies for bulk orders.

* To determine song preferences of global consumers across all the genres and to extract top 2% highly saleable songs. This data should be helpful:

	1.	to identify current trends for lucrative product-mix 

	2.	to optimally allocate limited budget to the targeted inventory purchase 

	3.	to reshape the marketing and sales strategies to maximize the bottom line
